#### An analysis on Adidas sales in the US for the year 2020 & 2021.
In this analysis, we used PowerBI to analyze Adidas' sales data for the years 2020 and 2021. The data used for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle and includes information on Adidas' sales by product category, region, and time period.

#### After analyzing the data, the following insights were obtained:
* Since men's street footwear is the most profitable, adidas could create more collabs with celebrities on other category to boost the sales rate. If not new designs on men's footwear to generate more sales.
* Improve on promotions for online purchase to boost online sales rate.
* Continuing relationships with retailers to maintain/improve future sales revenue.
* There is an increase of 205.38 million in profit growth in 2021 compared to 2020.



# What have I learnt from this analysis?
Through this analysis, we can see that Adidas experienced growth in the US market despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. We also learned that footwear is Adidas' primary product category and saw significant growth in 2021. 

## Personal Thoughts
Overall, this was a great learning experience for me as I was able to utilize PowerBI to analyze and visualize Adidas' sales data. It was interesting to see how the company performed during a challenging time and to see which product categories saw the most growth.
I hope I'll be able to get more proficent in PowerBI with more practice.
